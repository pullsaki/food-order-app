# SnackIN Food Order App
###### This Project is made to implement the concepts I know

## Demo Version

This is the link to demo version of the app deployed on github pages: https://pullsaki.github.io/food-order-app/

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open http://localhost:3000/ to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. You can use this build folder for the deploying purposes.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Progress
The project is almost done. I am planning on implementing Material UI on the components of this app.
